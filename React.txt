useState Hook==========================================================
The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
import { useState } from "react";
we are destructuring useState from react as it is a named export
Initialize useState----------------------
useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
The current state.
A function that updates the state.
function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("");
}
we set the initial state to an empty string: useState("")
<h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these
 const [car, setCar] = useState({
    brand: "Ford",
    year: "1964",
    color: "red"
  });
const updateColor = () => {
    setCar(previousState => {
      return { ...previousState, color: "blue" }
    });
  }
useEffect Hooks===========================================================
The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on every render
});
useEffect(() => {
  //Runs only on the first render
}, []);
useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on the first render
  //And any time any dependency value changes
}, [prop, state]);
return () => clearTimeout(timer)
React useContext Hook===============================================
React Context is a way to manage state globally.
The Problem
State should be held by the highest parent component in the stack that requires access to the state.

To illustrate, we have many nested components. The component at the top and bottom of the stack need access to the state.

To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as "props" through each nested component. This is called "prop drilling".

Even though components 2-4 did not need the state, they had to pass the state along so that it could reach component 5.
The Solution
The solution is to create context.

Context file---------------------

import { createContext, useState } from "react";

export const UserContext = createContext()


const TestContext = (props) => {
    const [Data,setData]=useState("apple")
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{Data,setData}}>
        {props.children}
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}
export default TestContext

App.js-------------------
import TestContext from './contexts/TestContext'
<TestContext>
all content 
</TestContext>

page --------------------------
import { UserContext } from '../../contexts/TestContext';
const abc = useContext(UserContext)
console.log("abc",abc)
abc.setData({"name":"ghulam","age":"1234"})
